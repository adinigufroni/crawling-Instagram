## **Welcome!**
###### We tried to crawling an Instagram account by using Instaloader. Like the other API, first we should check that our pc has already installed Python.
###### Then we run the codes in IDLE and the result will give us the datas that we want.

## (codes explaination)
###### 1. We should log in to an instagram account
###### 2. then we choose our account target
###### 3. from the account target's followers, we can get all the information from each follower's post such as id, caption, hashtags, number of likes, and comments.
